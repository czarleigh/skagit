	  	<h1>60-Day Money-Back Guarantee</h1>
	  		<p>Live with us for 60 days. During this time - and every day forward - we will do our best to ensure you love living in our community. But, if within the first 60 days of your move-in date, you become dissatisfied for any reason, we will refund the base rent that you paid for those 60 days, no questions asked.*</p>
	  		
	  		<p>*You must give the community's Executive Director a minimum of two weeks prior written notice of your intent to move out due to dissatisfaction. Refunds for this 60-Day Money-Back Guarantee will not be paid until written notice is received and the dissatisfied resident vacates the apartment. This offer extends only to the base rent paid for the first 60 days from the original move-in date. Any other fees paid during this time are not refundable. Other restrictions may apply. Please call for details.</p>
