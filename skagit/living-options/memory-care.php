	  		<h3>Our Philosophy</h3>
	  			<p><i><b>Today's Memories</b></i> is our centerpiece of care for residents with memory loss.  Each person has a story - an interesting history to be honored, a present to be enjoyed and a future to be filled with love.  Our approach is holistic, reaching beyond medical care to include emotional, social and spiritual caring.</p>
